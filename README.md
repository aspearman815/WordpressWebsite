# WordpressWebsite
Check out this Website I developed for a project in my Database Systems course! 
⭐️In order to create this site I utilized AWS. There I created an instance using Amazon's AMI HVM Linux server.
⭐️In the server I used commands to set up Apache, MariaDB, PhpMyAdmin, and install Wordpress.
⭐️After configuring Wordpress I used a few plugins to optimize my site. I also created a logo using Canva. :)
